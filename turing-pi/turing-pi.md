# Turing Pi 2

## Console Access

Red wire goes to TX on serial module
Brown wire goes to RX on serial modules
Black wire goes to ground

## Going between version 2.0.5 and 2.1.0

The /etc/network/interface file format changed, so if you go back and forth between these versions you need to manually, via the console cable, switch between these two files

I also had issues with flashing nodes via the web interface while using 2.1.0
