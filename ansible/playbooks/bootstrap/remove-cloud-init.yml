# Remove Cloud-Init
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# I want to make sure that all of the cloud-init packages and files are removed
# after first boot. Yes, one could just disable cloud-init to prevent it from
# starting. In my use case I have no additional need for cloud-init, so I am
# just removing it and all of its files.
